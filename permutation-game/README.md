Alice and Bob play the following game:

They choose a permutation of the numbers  to .
Alice plays first and they alternate.
In a turn, they can remove any one remaining number from the permutation.
The game ends when the remaining numbers form an increasing sequence of  or more numbers. The person who played the last turn (after which the sequence becomes increasing) wins the game.
Assuming both play optimally, who wins the game?

For example, if  the starting permutation might be . First, Alice chooses  or  (use  for the example) leaving . Since this is a decreasing sequence, Bob can remove any number for optimum play (he will lose regardless). Alice then removes any number leaving an array of only one element. Since Alice removed the last element to create an increasing sequence, Alice wins.

Function Description

Complete the permutationGame function in the editor below. It should return a string that represents the winner of the game, either Bob or Alice.

permutationGame has the following parameter:
- arr: an array of integers that represents the starting permutation

Input Format

The first line contains the number of test cases .

Each of the next  pairs of lines is in the following format:
- The first line contains an integer , the size of the array 
- The second line contains  space-separated integers,  where 

Constraints

The permutation will not be an increasing sequence initially.
Output Format

Output  lines, one for each test case, containing Alice if Alice wins the game and Bob otherwise.

Explanation

For the first test, Alice can remove the  or the  to make the sequence increasing and wins the game.

For the second test, if  is removed then the only way to have an increasing sequence is to only have  number left. This would take a total of  moves, thus allowing Bob to win. On the first move if Alice removes the , it will take  more moves to create an increasing sequence thus Bob wins. If Alice does not remove the , then Bob can remove it on his next turn to create the same game state to win (decreasing sequence,  numbers left).
