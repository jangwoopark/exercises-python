You are a waiter at a party. There are  stacked plates on pile . Each plate has a number written on it. Then there will be  iterations. In -th iteration, you start picking up the plates in  from the top one by one and check whether the number written on the plate is divisible by the -th prime. If the number is divisible, you stack that plate on pile . Otherwise, you stack that plate on pile . After  iterations, plates can only be on pile , . Output numbers on these plates from top to bottom of each piles in order of , .

Input Format

The first line contains two space separated integers,  and .
The next line contains  space separated integers representing the initial pile of plates, i.e., . The leftmost value represents the bottom plate of the pile.

Constraints




Output Format

Output  lines. Each line contains a number written on the plate. Printing should be done in the order defined above.

Initially:

 = [3, 4, 7, 6, 5]<-TOP

After 1 iteration:

 = []<-TOP

 = [6, 4]<-TOP

 = [5, 7, 3]<-TOP

We should output numbers in  first from top to bottom, and then output numbers in  from top to bottom.

Sample Input 1

Explanation 1

Initially:

 = [3, 3, 4, 4, 9]<-TOP

After  iteration:

 = []<-TOP

 = [4, 4]<-TOP

 = [3, 3, 9]<-TOP

After  iteration:

 = []<-TOP

 = [4, 4]<- TOP

 = [3, 3, 9]<-TOP

We should output numbers in  first from top to bottom, and then output numbers in  from top to bottom.
