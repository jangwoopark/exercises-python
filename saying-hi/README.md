Explanation

The first sentence satisfies the RegEx criteria set forth in the Problem Statement (starts with the case-insensitive word , followed by a space, followed by a letter that is not ), so we print the sentence on a new line.

The second sentence fails our RegEx criteria, as the second word/token starts with a  (so we print nothing).

The third sentence fails our RegEx criteria, as it doesn't start with an  (so we print nothing).

The fourth sentence fails our RegEx criteria, as the third character in the sentence is not a space (so we print nothing).

The fifth sentence fails as our RegEx criteria, as the sentence does not start with the word  (so we print nothing).
