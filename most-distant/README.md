Keko has  dots in a 2-D coordinate plane. He wants to measure the gap between the most distant two dots. To make the problem easier, Keko decided to change each dot's  or  coordinate to zero.

Help Keko calculate the distance!

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , the number of dots.
The next  lines each contain the integer coordinates of the dots in  fashion.

Constraints


It is guaranteed that all dots are distinct, and either their  or  coordinate is equal to .

Output Format

Print the distance between the most distant dots with an absolute error of, at most, .
