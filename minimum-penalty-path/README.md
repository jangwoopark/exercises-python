Consider an undirected graph containing  nodes and  edges. Each edge  has an integer cost, , associated with it.

The penalty of a path is the bitwise OR of every edge cost in the path between a pair of nodes,  and . In other words, if a path contains edges , then the penalty for this path is  OR  OR ... OR .

Given a graph and two nodes,  and , find the path between  and  having the minimal possible penalty and print its penalty; if no such path exists, print  to indicate that there is no path from  to .

Note: Loops and multiple edges are allowed. The bitwise OR operation is known as or in Pascal and as | in C++ and Java.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers,  (the number of nodes) and  (the number of edges), respectively.

Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers , , and , respectively, describing edge  connecting the nodes  and  and its associated penalty ().

The last line contains two space-separated integers,  (the starting node) and  (the ending node), respectively.

Constraints

Output Format

Print the minimal penalty for the optimal path from node  to node ; if no path exists from node  to node , print .

Sample Input

Sample Output

3
Explanation

The optimal path is .
 and .
The penalty for this path is:  OR , so we print .
