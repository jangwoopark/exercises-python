In mathematics, binomial coefficients are a family of positive integers that occur as coefficients in the binomial theorem.  

denotes the number of ways of choosing k objects from n different objects.
However when n and k are too large, we often save them after modulo operation by a prime number P. Please calculate how many binomial coefficients of n become to 0 after modulo by P.

Input Format
The first of input is an integer , the number of test cases.
Each of the following  lines contains 2 integers,  and prime .

Constraints



Output Format

For each test case, output a line contains the number of   s (0<=k<=n)  each of which after modulo operation by P is 0.
